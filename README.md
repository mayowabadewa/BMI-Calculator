# BMI-Calculator
The Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator.

This is a simple Python program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m).

The result from the calculation will tell us:

  Under 18.5 they are underweight
  Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
  Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
  Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
  Above 35 they are clinically obese.
